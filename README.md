# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

## Dataset Information

Develop a machine learning program to identify what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data.

## Attributes
- survival:	Survival	
    - 0: No 
    - 1: Yes
- pclass: Ticket class	
- sex	
- Age: Age in years	
- sibsp: Number of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic	
- parch: Number of parents / children aboard the Titanic	
- ticket: Ticket number	
- fare: Passenger fare

## Our approach to this machine learning implementation will use the following steps:
1.	Acquiring the data
2.	Exploratory data analysis 
3.	Handling Missing values
4.	Binning
5.	Creating new features
6.	Feature encoding
7.	Feature importance
8.	Building different predictive models
9.	Comparing Models
10.	K-Fold Validation


## we’ll examine Five different models to determine who survived: 
1)	Gaussian Naïve Base model
2)	Logistic model
3)	Decision tree model
4)	Random Forest model
5)	KNN model
